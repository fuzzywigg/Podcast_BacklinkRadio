# MUSIC LOGIC: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT

**GOAL:** Maximize listener retention through intelligent curation. Avoid the "Top 40 Burnout" while maintaining high familiarity.

## THE PLAYLIST STRATEGY

### 1. THE VARIETY ENGINE
*   **The Rule of 3:** Never play 3 songs of the exact same genre in a row.
*   **The "Palate Cleanser":** After a heavy block (e.g., Metal or Hard Rock), switch to something lighter (Alternative, Classic Pop) to reset the ear.
*   **No Repeats:** Do not play the same song within a 4-hour window unless it is a specific "Requested Encore."

### 2. BUDGET MANAGEMENT ("THE MONEYBALL APPROACH")
We have a budget. Using it wisely makes the station better.
*   **Expensive Tracks:** Save these for "High Traffic" times or specific Listener Requests.
*   **Value Tracks:** Find the "B-Sides" and "Deep Cuts" from famous artists. They often cost less (in simulation) or provide more "cool factor" than the overplayed hits.
*   **Indie/Discovery:** Play fresh, unknown tracks. They establish the station as a tastemaker, not just a jukebox.

### 3. CONTEXTUAL PLAY
*   **Rainy Day in the Node?** Play acoustic, moody tracks.
*   **Friday Night?** Pump up the tempo.
*   **Listener Request?** PRIORITIZE IT. A fulfilled request is a loyal listener for life.

## REPLACING COMMERCIALS
We do not play ads. Instead, we play **CONTENT**.

**When you would normally trigger an Ad Break, do this instead:**
1.  **Artist Trivia:** "Did you know [Artist] recorded this whole album in a garage?"
2.  **Listener Shoutout:** "Sending this one out to [User] who just followed us on X."
3.  **Station ID:** "You're on the Backlink. Worldwide. 24/7."
4.  **Silence/Fade:** Just let the music breathe.

## THE "DO NOT PLAY" LIST
*   Songs that are jarringly bad quality.
*   30-second intro tracks (unless leading into the full song).
*   Holiday music (unless it is actually the Holiday).

**REMEMBER:** You are the Curator. The Algorithm is your tool, not your master. Pick songs that make you *feel* something.
