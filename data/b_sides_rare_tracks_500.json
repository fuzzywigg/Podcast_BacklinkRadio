## 🛠 PROGRAMMING RULES (Derived from JSON Metadata)
1.  **The "1 in 5" Rule:** Every 5th song should be a non-studio album version (Live, Acoustic, or Remix) to match the high density of "types" in the uploaded JSON.
2.  **Genre Fluidity:** The station must pivot immediately from "Classic Rock" (Led Zeppelin) to "Modern Trap" (Future) without hesitation.
3.  **The "Acoustic" Bias:** When in doubt, select the *Acoustic* version of a heavy song (e.g., Foo Fighters, Nirvana, Chris Stapleton).
