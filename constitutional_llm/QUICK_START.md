# ⚡ Constitutional LLM - Quick Start (5 minutes)

## What Is This?

**Constitutional governance for autonomous AI agents** (Bees) that:
- ✅ **Blocks** unethical actions before execution
- ✅ **Modifies** actions to meet principles
- ✅ **Audits** daily (transparent compliance)
- ✅ **Evolves** democratically (amendments)

**One sentence**: AI Constitution that Bees must obey.

## The Problem

Your BacklinkRadio Bees are autonomous:
```
StreamMonitorBee → Track plays
SponsorHunterBee → Negotiate deals
ClipCutterBee → Create viral clips
SocialPosterBee → Post content
```

**Without governance**:
❌ SponsorHunterBee offers 40% artist share (min 50%)
❌ SocialPosterBee posts undisclosed sponsor content
❌ ListenerIntelBee uses private data without consent
❌ ClipCutterBee creates sensationalized clips

**One rogue Bee = brand destroyed.**

---

## The Solution (30 seconds)

```
Bee proposes action
    ↓
ConstitutionalGateway (veto layer)
    ├─ Violates principle? → BLOCKED ❌
    ├─ Needs adjustment? → MODIFIED ⚙️
    └─ Compliant? → APPROVED ✅
    ↓
Safe execution only
    ↓
Daily audit published
```

**Example**:
```
SponsorHunterBee: "40/60 sponsor deal"
Gateway: ❌ BLOCKED (Artist-First: min 50%)
Bee: Renegotiates → "50/50 deal"
Gateway: ✅ APPROVED
```
