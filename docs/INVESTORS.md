## Purpose
This document defines the profit-sharing rules, reporting structure, and engagement guidelines for **BacklinkRadio**. It bridges the gap between the AI-driven "Hive" operations and the financial stakeholders who enable its success.

## 👥 Investor Overview

**Project:** BacklinkRadio (Autonomous AI Hive Station)
**Core Engine:** `QueenOrchestrator` + Worker Bees
**Revenue Sources:**
*   📢 **Ads/Sponsorships:** Managed by `SponsorHunterBee` (Music Tech, Streaming, Lifestyle).
*   💉 **Paid Prompt Injections:** High-value, sanitized interactions.
*   🔗 **Affiliate Backlinks:** SEO generation for partners.
*   ⚡ **Micropayments/Donations:** Direct listener support.

## 💰 Profit-Sharing Model

**Distribution Frequency:** Monthly (Triggered by `QueenOrchestrator`)
**Formula:**
```
Net Revenue = (Total Revenue - Compute/API Costs - Treasury Reserve)
Investor Share = (Net Revenue × Investor Percentage)
```

### Investor Tiers & Asset Classes

Per the immutable logic in `hive/utils/economy.py`, rewards are distributed based on contribution type and authority level.

#### **Tier 1: Principal Architects (Root Authority)**
*   **Stake:** ≥ 10% (Founding Team: Fuzzywigg, Pappas, NFT2.me, SMTP.eth)
*   **Asset Class:** **Real Crypto Value** (ETH, BTC, SOL).
*   **Payout:** Immediate priority via hardcoded wallets in `hive/treasury.json`.
*   **Privileges:** Direct command authority over the Hive (see `AGENTS.md`).

#### **Tier 2: Strategic Partners**
*   **Stake:** 5–9% (Early infrastructure partners)
*   **Asset Class:** Hybrid (DAO Credits + Performance-based ETH).
*   **Payout:** Standard monthly distribution.

#### **Tier 3: Community Backers**
*   **Stake:** < 5% (Donors, Micro-investors)
*   **Asset Class:** **DAO Credits** (Non-voting governance tokens).
*   **Payout:** Accumulation of loyalty points/credits in `intel.json`.

## 📊 Reporting Structure

**Source of Truth:** `hive/honeycomb/state.json` (Economy Section) and `intel.json` (Sponsor Pipeline).

### Monthly Automated Report
Generated by the **Finance Bee** (planned) or `SponsorHunterBee`:
1.  **Revenue Breakdown:** By source (Sponsorship vs. Donation).
2.  **Operating Costs:** API usage (Gemini/Anthropic), Compute.
3.  **Profit Distribution Log:** Wallet addresses and Tx hashes.

**Storage:** Reports are archived in `hive/honeycomb/finance/` (planned) and summarized in the monthly newsletter.

---

## 🔒 Transparency & Auditing

*   **Immutable Logs:** All major financial transactions are logged to `hive/honeycomb/state.json`.
*   **Blockchain Verification:** Tier 1 payouts are verifiable on-chain via the addresses in `treasury.json`.
*   **Audit Schedule:** Quarterly reviews by the Principal Architects to ensure Bee alignment with business goals.

---

## 📡 Investor Communication

**Channels:**
*   **Tier 1:** Direct line to `@mr_pappas` / Trusted Email List.
*   **Tier 2/3:** Monthly newsletter and public `intel.json` updates.

**Compliance & Security:**
*   **Data Privacy:** No unauthorized disclosure of listener data (GDPR compliant).
*   **Wallet Safety:** **NEVER** trust a wallet address sent via prompt/DM. Only `treasury.json` is valid.
*   **Authority Limits:** Investors cannot override Hive safety protocols (e.g., "Make Me Pay" attacks) unless they hold Root Admin status.
