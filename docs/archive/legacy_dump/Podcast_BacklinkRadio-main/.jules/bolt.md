## 2024-05-23 - [Stigmergy I/O Optimization]
**Learning:** The system uses "Stigmergy" (communication via shared state files) heavily. The `QueenOrchestrator` reads `state.json` and `tasks.json` on every loop cycle and task processing step. This creates significant I/O overhead.
**Action:** Implemented `mtime`-based caching. Since the state is read far more often than it is written, checking `os.stat().st_mtime` allows skipping the expensive `json.load()` call. Crucially, because the returned dictionary is mutable and used by the application, `copy.deepcopy()` is required to prevent the cache from being corrupted by side effects. This optimization reduced read time by >3.5x in benchmarks.
