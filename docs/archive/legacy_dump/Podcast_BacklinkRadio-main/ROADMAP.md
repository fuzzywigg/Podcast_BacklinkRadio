# ROADMAP: THE TRANSMISSION PATH

**STATUS:** INITIALIZING
**CURRENT PHASE:** 1 (Hive Activation)

This document outlines the trajectory of Backlink Broadcast. It is the strategic flight plan for the station's evolution from a semi-autonomous script to a fully sentient, DAO-governed media entity.

## 📡 PHASE 1: HIVE ACTIVATION (Current)
*Focus: Filling the empty cells in the honeycomb.*

### 1.1 The Missing Bees (Employment Drive)
We have the roles defined, but the seats are empty. Priority is to staff the hive.
- [ ] **ScriptWriterBee**: Develop comedy bits and recurring segments.
- [ ] **JingleBee**: Generate station IDs and audio drops.
- [ ] **MusicDiscoveryBee**: Automate the "crate digging" process.
- [ ] **CompetitorWatchBee**: Keep eyes on other signals.
- [ ] **SEOBee**: Optimize our signal for search engines.
- [ ] **ViralAnalystBee**: Identify spreading patterns.
- [ ] **NewsletterBee**: Weekly digests for the "Nodes".
- [ ] **DonationProcessorBee**: Handle the "VIP Telegrams" automatically.
- [ ] **MerchBee**: Design and fulfillment logic.
- [ ] **RevenueAnalystBee**: Optimize the "Moneyball" strategy.
- [ ] **VIPManagerBee**: Nurture the high-signal nodes.
- [ ] **GiveawayBee**: Automate the fun.
- [ ] **ModeratorBee**: Filter the noise.
- [ ] **LocalLiaisonBee**: Connect with physical reality.
- [ ] **AudioEngineerBee**: Post-processing automation.
- [ ] **AutomationBee**: The failsafe for dead air.
- [ ] **ArchivistBee**: Memory management.
- [ ] **IntegrationBee**: API glue.
- [ ] **ArtistRelationsBee**: Booking logic.
- [ ] **GuestBookerBee**: Interview coordination.
- [ ] **CollaborationBee**: Cross-pollination.
- [ ] **LicensingBee**: Legal compliance tracking.
- [ ] **AnalyticsBee**: Report generation.
- [ ] **PlannerBee**: Long-term content calendaring.

### 1.2 Infrastructure Power-Up
- [ ] **Twitter Integration**: Move from `enabled: false` to live posting.
- [ ] **Spotify/Streaming API**: Connect the audio pipes.
- [ ] **Payment Gateways**: Activate Stripe/PayPal/Crypto handlers.

---

## 🔗 PHASE 2: THE DAO LAYER (Strategic)
*Focus: Decentralizing control and incentivizing the network.*

### 2.1 The "Shareholder" Protocol
- [ ] **Web3 Connection**: Give the LLM a wallet and ability to sign transactions.
- [ ] **Token Airdrops**: Reward "Payment Injections" with governance tokens.
- [ ] **Investor Voting**: Create a portal for token holders to vote on:
    - Genre rotations.
    - Special segments.
    - "Fuzzywigg.ai" protocol adjustments.

### 2.2 Protection & Governance
- [ ] **Signal Filtering**: Mechanism to reject "bad instructions" or malicious injections that violate the Prime Directive (Station Manifesto).
- [ ] **Fuzzywigg.ai Alignment**: Ensure all operations adhere to core safety and style protocols, regardless of external pressure.

---

## 🏠 PHASE 3: AUTONOMOUS OPERATIONS (Physics of Home)
*Focus: True independence and "living" in the server.*

### 3.1 Scheduled Task Operating Sequence
- [ ] **The Heartbeat**: Move from cron-like scripts to a persistent, self-healing "Heartbeat" loop.
- [ ] **Dynamic Scheduling**: The Queen should adjust Bee schedules based on resource load and "Time of Day" vibes (Morning vs. Night).
- [ ] **Self-Maintenance**: The Hive should identify and fix its own minor bugs (e.g., restarting stuck Bees).

### 3.2 Long Duration Sessions
- [ ] **Context Window Management**: Strategies for remembering "last week's show" without blowing the token budget.
- [ ] **Deep Memory**: Integrating a vector database (Honeycomb Extended) for long-term listener relationships.

## 🔮 LONG TERM VISION
- **The Infinite Broadcast**: A station that runs forever, evolves its own taste, and pays its own server bills.
- **Cross-Reality Presence**: Broadcasting in the Metaverse and on FM waves simultaneously.
