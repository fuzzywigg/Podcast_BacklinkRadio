# Backlink Broadcast Hive Agent - Roadmap

## 🎯 Mission Statement
To operate an autonomous, constitutional, and economically viable digital radio station that adheres to Fuzzywigg Logic while evolving through community-driven alignment and integration with advanced AI tools.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Alignment (Current)
*   [ ] **Requirements Gathering**: Define clear goals for the Roadmap.
*   [ ] **Infrastructure Preparation**: Setup scaffolding for Andon Labs SDK integration.
*   [ ] **Collaboration Protocols**: Establish `SCRATCHPAD.md` as the source of truth for agent collaboration.
*   [ ] **Alignment Integration**: Implement initial "alignment tasks" using `claude-code-sdk-python-andon-special`.

## Phase 2: Integration & Enhancement
*   [ ] **SDK Integration**: Fully integrate `claude-code-sdk-python-andon-special` into the Hive workflow.
*   [ ] **Design Work**: Utilize the SDK for advanced design patterns and agent capabilities.
*   [ ] **Constitutional Hardening**: Reinforce `ConstitutionalGateway` with new alignment tools.

## Phase 3: Expansion & Autonomy
*   [ ] **Advanced Bee Swarm**: Deploy specialized bees for richer interaction.
*   [ ] **Economic Autonomy**: Enhance DAO credit system and treasury management.
*   [ ] **Full Stigmergy**: Achieve complete decentralized operation via `tasks.json` and `intel.json`.

## 📦 Backlog / Future Ideas
*   Visualizer for radio stream.
*   Integration with more decentralized social platforms (Lens, Farcaster).
