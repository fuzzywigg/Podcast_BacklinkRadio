## Template 1: Direct to Agent

Subject: Podcast Interview Request - [ATHLETE NAME] | 2026 Winter Olympics Feature

Hi [AGENT NAME],

I'm producing "Backlink Radio," a podcast spotlighting the human stories behind Team USA's 2026 Winter Olympic athletes. We focus on personal journeys, mental health, and the sacrifices that don't make the highlight reels.

We'd love to feature [ATHLETE NAME] for a 30-45 minute interview covering:
- Their path to Milan-Cortina qualification
- Life outside competition
- Message to aspiring athletes

Format: Remote audio (Riverside.fm), athlete-approved edit, promotion across our channels + athlete can share.

Timeline: Flexible, pre-Games release (Jan 2026 target)

Happy to send full show info and past episodes. Would [ATHLETE] be available for a brief call to discuss?

Best,
[YOUR NAME]

Hey [ATHLETE]! 👋

Working on a podcast featuring Team USA athletes heading to Milan-Cortina—not the stats, but the real stories. Would love to chat about your journey if you're open to it. 

No pressure, just good conversation. DM me or my team can connect with yours.
